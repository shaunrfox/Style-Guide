Talk about width, height, padding, margin, border, box-sizing

The Box-model is the basis for the strucure of elements on the web. In the original design of the box-model, padding, margin, and border units would add to the size of the div. (That's the old way)

In the new way (using `box-sizing: border-box;`), padding and border push into the set dimensions of the div. This allows for much easier calculations and control of item spacing.
